    "    \"The Sumaco Horned Frog is not considered highly poisonous or toxic. It does not possess the potent skin toxins seen in some other frog species.\",\n",
    "    \"The Sumaco Horned Frog gets its name from the distinctive bony horn-like protrusions above its eyes, which give it a unique appearance.These frogs have a cryptic coloration, often resembling moss or lichen, helping them blend into their forest environment. They are known for their unique reproductive behavior, with males guarding eggs and tadpoles, which they carry on their backs. This species is native to a specific and limited geographic range, making it an interesting subject of study and conservation concern.\"',\n",
